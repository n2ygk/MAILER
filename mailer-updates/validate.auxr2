R202018    Remove PRINT NOGENs, make DSECTs honor SYSPARM(SUP)/SYSPARM(EXP)
R202009    Support userid aliases in INCOMING table.  This allows a

*          entry instead of 1 entry per node.  The format for these
*          entries will be a node of '*default*' and a userid of the
*          specific userid
R200009    Allow multiple Rscs-Domains.
R200008    Allow multiple Local-Hosts.
R200007    VALIDATE doesn't understand LocalDomain.
R200006    VALIDATE changes MAILUSER and MAILNODE without changing
*          MAILULEN and MAILNLEN. Force them to 8 each.
