The FWD command is used to establish and change mail and file           00011000
forwarding for a CMS userid.  Mail may be forwarded independently       00012000
of any file forwarding that is done.  Different file classes may        00013000
be forwarded to different userids or all files can be forwarded to      00014000
only 1 userid.                                                          00015000

    mail delivery to the userid being forwarded stops.  The special     00108000

    Make the forwarding changes to the specified userid.  Normally FWD  00119000
    makes changes to the userid of the user.  This option can only be   00120000

    When using the FOR option, FWD verifies that the userid exists.  It 00125000
    is occasionally necessary to set up forwards for ids that do not    00126000
    exist.  FORCE tells FWD to allow forwardings to be created for ids  00127000
    that don't exist.                                                   00128000

The FWD command works with addresses in two formats, NJE and RFC822.  An00143000
NJE address corresponds to a destination (a machine id and a userid) on 00144000
the RSCS network.  This address could be within Princeton or on BITNET. 00145000
An NJE address must be coded wherever 'NJEaddress' is specified in the  00146000
command description.  The format for an NJE address is either 'userid'  00147000
or 'userid@node'.                                                       00148000

An RFC822 address is coded as 'userid@host.domain'.  It is normally used00150000
to specify an internet destination.  An RFC822 address or an NJE address00151000
may be coded wherever 'address' is specified in the command description.00152000
